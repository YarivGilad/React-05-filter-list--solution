## Pick a Bot!!   


1. Create a `<Profile>` component
2. import `<Profile>` and create an instance of it in the `<App>`.
3. Every time the user clicks on an item in `<List>`,
   the `<Profile>` component needs to be updated and display the selcted item data.
4. We need to use the same technique as we did with the filter list task.
   The `<App>` is the only component who has a state.
   We can pass a setter function as a prop to the `<List>` and update the state in `<App>`
   You can modify the `<App>` state as you see fit.
